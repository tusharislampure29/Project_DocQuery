*Prerequisites
Ensure that MySQL Server and a MySQL Client (such as MySQL Workbench or command line tools) are installed on your system.

*Database Setup Instructions
1 Create the Database: Begin by creating the you_database database.
2 Create a New User: Set up a new MySQL user named DATA with the password 1234567.
3 Grant Privileges: Assign all necessary privileges on the you_database to the DATA user, and then refresh the privileges.
4 Verify User Creation: Confirm that the DATA user has been successfully created in the MySQL system.
5 Update User Authentication Method (Optional): If needed, change the authentication method of the DATA user to use mysql_native_password.
6 Set Root User Password and Privileges: For security, update the root user's password and ensure it has all privileges on the you_database.

*Running the SQL Script
To execute the SQL commands, you can use either the MySQL command line interface or MySQL Workbench. Connect to your MySQL server and execute the commands as needed.
